## Factorial of a Number

- [Source code](./factorial_of_n.cpp)

- In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n:
`n! = n . (n-1) . (n-2) . (n-3) ...... 3 . 2 . 1`  
For example,  `5! = 5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 = 120`  
The value of `0!` is `1`, according to the convention for an empty product. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)]

## Prime Number
A natural number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a prime number (or a prime) if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.

The first 25 prime numbers (all the prime numbers less than 100) are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 .
